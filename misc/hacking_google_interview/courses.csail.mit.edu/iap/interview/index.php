<h2>Learn the tricks. Beat the system.</h2>
<p>
Ever wanted to work at a company like Google, Apple, or Facebook? There's just one thing standing in your way: the interview. But there's no need to fear. We've mastered the interview questions and topics, and we want to show you how you can nail every programming question. Whether you're a beginning programmer or a seasoned expert, this class is for you.
</p>
<p>
The class focuses on computer science topics that frequently come up in programming interviews. It covers time complexity, hash tables, binary search trees, and some other things you might learn in 6.046. However, most of the time is devoted to topics you won't learn in class, such as crafty bitwise logic and tricks to solving problems.
</p>
<p>
If you have any interest in working at a computer science company, make sure you don't miss this class!
</p>
<p>
The class is held in room 32-124 from 5:00-6:30 PM on January 12 - 15, 2009.
